# Jakdlugo

This gem is a simple command line tool for Launch School students to estimate how long the curriculum will take.

## How it works
A common question LS students have is "How long does Launch School take?", so there is a post in the forums where students answer how long it took for them. This gem takes the data from that forum post, loads it into a Postgres database and provides a few subcommands that query that database.

The original name for this gem "how long" was taken, so "jak d≈Çugo" is the Polish translation.

## Usage
